				For my Passion Project, I would like to create a website that displays the nearest gym locations for individual users. The purpose will be for users to locate the nearest gym according to their gym memberships and calculate the commute to each gym in real-time. The user will be able to set their "home" gym, that would be the gym displayed first, while nearby gyms provide alternative options. The website can display other gyms and classes around the area to provide the individual users options to attend other gyms / classes as oppose to their "home" gym due to traffic or change of interest. The purpose is for the user to know exactly how long it takes to get to their gym and all alternatives to encourage a healthy lifestyle.
